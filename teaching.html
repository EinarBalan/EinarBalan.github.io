        <h1>I love teaching.</h1>

        <p> most recently I TA'd for Violet Peng's CS 162: Natural Language Processing. You can find my slides for that <a

        <p>previously, I TA'd for Carey Nachenberg's offering of <a
            href="https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/fall-23-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS
            131: Programming Languages</a>. You can find my slides for that <a

        <p>I also helped teach CS 131: Programming Languages and <a
                href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DNKVJRr5dnqNyHzU4-5QQFA3SXILE10n?usp=drive_link"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS 32: Data Structures and Algorithms</a> under the wonderful LA program, which I highly
            recommend participating in if you're an undergrad at UCLA!</p>
        <p>I also taught a number of beginner-friendly workshops generally related to web development as part of ACM
            Hack. I've done my best to compile a list of those here if you're interested!</p>

        <p>here is some feedback from students I've taught that I look at whenever I am feeling down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Amazing TA, he made a lot of effort to keep us engaged and to make discussion fun. I hope he continues doing what he is currently doing!
            </li>
            <li>
                Best ta i have ever had at UCLA! 2x
            </li>
            <li>
                Down-to-earth guy that was very open about helping us students succeed. Never felt like there was a "dumb question" in class
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is a fantastic TA. Very thoughtful and cares a lot about his students.
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is an excellent TA and his obvious love for teaching is reflected in the strength of his discussion section. His presentations are very clear and cover all relevant topics, and almost always at the perfect level of detail for the class. The one weakness I see might be more of a weakness with the course itself than discussion, but homeworks and tests often brought up material covered in discussion but not in lecture - but the course listing doesn't officially have a discussion and this was more of an optional TA office hours, so it felt a little unfair to be tested on things brought up here.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most TAs don't really care about the students in discussion but he really did! Super nice, always was trying to improve discussions to make them as helpful as possible, and overall, one of the best TAs here at UCLA!
            </li>
            <li>
                Similar to the professor, very friendly energetic and engaging. Always made discussions very fun to attend, with games and snacks. Fun slides, yet very informative and helped greatly with my understanding of the material. Amazing!
            </li>
            <li>
                This TA is excellent!! He was concerned about our learning and gave us snacks. He ensured that we were prepared for the exams. One issue (not because of the TA) is that discussions weren't listed when enrolling for classes, causing a lot of scheduling conflicts if I wanted to attend. I hope this is fixed next time.
            </li>
            <li>
                As a third-year, I have had many TAs to date. However, I say without exaggeration that Einar has been the best TA I have had so far. Although it is his first year as a master's student, his slides are incredibly well-made, and he is hugely passionate about helping us succeed. The balance between content review, practice, and project hints is perfect - a quick review followed by nuanced practice, and lots of project guidance without giving answers away - and even though we don't often have time to cover all the slides in class, I have benefitted greatly from them on their own after discussion as well. I hope in future quarters that he continues with his Kahoot style questions and exam-prep Kahoots! Einar is highly approachable and receptive to feedback, and I am immensely grateful to have had him as a TA.
                (On a serious note, I personally believe he deserves a pay raise! He truly goes above and beyond to help his students.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is a caring and knowledgeable TA who is always on top of everything. He communicates exceptionally well and goes above and beyond to ensure students learn effectively during his discussion sessions. His dedication to teaching is evident, and he provides valuable tips and guidance that make a real difference in understanding the material.
                I highly recommend Einar as a TA for anyone looking for genuine help and clear explanations. He truly enhances the learning experience!
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar was one of the best TAs I have had at UCLA, he was so willing to do everything in his power to help students learn as much as possible and hold office hours even outside of his discussion and set office hours time. I really wish I could have him as my TA for other courses as well, he did great. The slides he made were fun and easy to keep up with while putting a good summary of the week with a couple practice problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar's discussions were very helpful. He would go above and beyond with extensive slides to help us understand. His review presentations helped a lot, understanding what kinds of questions will be on the exam. I think this was his first time being a TA, and he was great. 
            </li>
            <li>
                bro's the goat too holy
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is one of the best LA's i've ever come across in my time at UCLA. You can definitely tell he's passionate about teaching and it reflects in the compassion he shows his students. He made me feel like I belong in Engineering especially CS-32 has been my most challenging class in all of undergrad
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is an amazing LA. He made me feel seen throughout this quarter and cares about his students. He has shown a lot of compassion which makes me feel heard especially since I've struggled with CS 32 in the past. He's super knowledgable in his subject and he's gonna be an amazing computer scientist
            </li>
            <li>
                Absolutely wonderful LA, really cared about teaching and put a lot of effort in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Best LA I've ever had, would definitely take a course supported by this LA again. Thanks for making me
                look forward to discussion and always investing so much time and effort into helping us learn!
            </li>
            <Li>
                Super approachable, lots of effort into helping us learn, goes above and beyond in every category
            </Li>
            <li>
                Einar makes discussions actually engaging and really cares that everyone understands the content. He had
                us wear name tags so that we actually would talk to each other which is so thoughtful and much
                appreciated for a CS discussion. He is actually such a good LA and goes above and beyond. He made a
                kahoot and brings snacks!!!
            </li>
            <li>
                His approachability and effort to create a welcoming, comfortable environment during discussion section
                stands out amongst all LA-supported courses that I've been a part of
            </li>
            <li> 
                Everyone is so thankful for the effort you put into discussions! The time and effort you put into
                making discussion educational and enjoyable is appreciated by everone in the section. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Super funny and knowledgeable about material!! Discussion sections were super helpful 
            </li>
            <li>
                It is evident that the LAs in my discussion session pour their heart and soul into the materials. They give us useful slides, helpful diagrams, and even the occasional activity (like Kahoot). These have helped me see computer science in a way that I haven't before. Instead of staring at lines of code, the LAs help us build understanding of CS and why things are the way they are.
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is very approachable and engaging. He makes me look forward to the discussion sections because he makes them so fun
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is super engaging and actually treats me like a person. He makes me feel like it's okay to not understand data structures right away and is very helpful with going through a step by step process
            </li>
            <li>
                Adapting to what the students need. He takes feedback really well, and implements them into the lesson plan- which is quite rare in my experience with LAs here. I love his enthusiasm, the slides are awesome, and he explains concepts pretty well. Whenever I have a question, he will figure out a way to deliver the answer to me, and gives me great advice for solving projects (thanks for the tip to use circular doubly linked lists).
            </li>
            <li>
                thanks so much Einar! You were definitely one of the best instructors in my undergrad and im super happy to have met you 🙏🏿 keep inspiring others, you are born to teach
            </li>
        </ul>
