        <h1>I love teaching.</h1>

        <p> I'm currently a TA for Violet Peng's CS 162: Natural Language Processing. You can find my slides for that <a

        <p>previously, I TA'd for Carey Nachenberg's offering of <a
            href="https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/fall-23-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS
            131: Programming Languages</a>. You can find my slides for that <a

            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

        <p>I also helped teach CS 131: Programming Languages and <a
                href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DNKVJRr5dnqNyHzU4-5QQFA3SXILE10n?usp=drive_link"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS 32: Data Structures and Algorithms</a> under the wonderful LA program, which I highly
            recommend participating in if you're an undergrad at UCLA!</p>
        <p>I also taught a number of beginner-friendly workshops generally related to web development as part of ACM
            Hack. I've done my best to compile a list of those here if you're interested!</p>

        <p>here is some feedback from students I've taught that I look at whenever I am feeling down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Einar is one of the best LA's i've ever come across in my time at UCLA. You can definitely tell he's passionate about teaching and it reflects in the compassion he shows his students. He made me feel like I belong in Engineering especially CS-32 has been my most challenging class in all of undergrad
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is an amazing LA. He made me feel seen throughout this quarter and cares about his students. He has shown a lot of compassion which makes me feel heard especially since I've struggled with CS 32 in the past. He's super knowledgable in his subject and he's gonna be an amazing computer scientist
            </li>
            <li>
                Absolutely wonderful LA, really cared about teaching and put a lot of effort in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Best LA I've ever had, would definitely take a course supported by this LA again. Thanks for making me
                look forward to discussion and always investing so much time and effort into helping us learn!
            </li>
            <Li>
                Super approachable, lots of effort into helping us learn, goes above and beyond in every category
            </Li>
            <li>
                Einar makes discussions actually engaging and really cares that everyone understands the content. He had
                us wear name tags so that we actually would talk to each other which is so thoughtful and much
                appreciated for a CS discussion. He is actually such a good LA and goes above and beyond. He made a
                kahoot and brings snacks!!!
            </li>
            <li>
                His approachability and effort to create a welcoming, comfortable environment during discussion section
                stands out amongst all LA-supported courses that I've been a part of
            </li>
            <li> 
                Everyone is so thankful for the effort you put into discussions! The time and effort you put into
                making discussion educational and enjoyable is appreciated by everone in the section. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Super funny and knowledgeable about material!! Discussion sections were super helpful 
            </li>
            <li>
                It is evident that the LAs in my discussion session pour their heart and soul into the materials. They give us useful slides, helpful diagrams, and even the occasional activity (like Kahoot). These have helped me see computer science in a way that I haven't before. Instead of staring at lines of code, the LAs help us build understanding of CS and why things are the way they are.
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is very approachable and engaging. He makes me look forward to the discussion sections because he makes them so fun
            </li>
            <li>
                Einar is super engaging and actually treats me like a person. He makes me feel like it's okay to not understand data structures right away and is very helpful with going through a step by step process
            </li>
            <li>
                Adapting to what the students need. He takes feedback really well, and implements them into the lesson plan- which is quite rare in my experience with LAs here. I love his enthusiasm, the slides are awesome, and he explains concepts pretty well. Whenever I have a question, he will figure out a way to deliver the answer to me, and gives me great advice for solving projects (thanks for the tip to use circular doubly linked lists).
            </li>
            <li>
                thanks so much Einar! You were definitely one of the best instructors in my undergrad and im super happy to have met you üôèüèø keep inspiring others, you are born to teach
            </li>
        </ul>
