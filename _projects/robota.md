Robota Intervals was the first app I ever released, and it was designed with the motivation of creating an intuitive and completely free workout designer. I personally am a fan of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), so this app was created with that workout style in mind. 

It was written in Java and was basically my introduction to Object Oriented Programming in a large application. As such, there are many things I look back on and wish I could have done better. For instance, rather than follow an established app architecture such as MVVM, I created my own architecture that is far from perfect. If I was to go back and remake the project, I would be sure to follow all the native android best practices as well as maintain a cohesive app architecture to improve the maintainability of the app.
