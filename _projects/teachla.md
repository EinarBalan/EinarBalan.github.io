Teach LA is a subcommitte of the computer science club ACM at UCLA dedicated to providing underserved kids with a free computer science education. I am a member of the subcommitte and am currently on both the developer team and video creation team. Obviously, I am not the sole contributor to this website or even a majority contributor as I just joined the club recently, but I did work on the python curriculum page, lesson page, and squashed a couple bugs that were left over in other parts of the website. I also taught in about half of the videos!

This was my first venture into web development, and I'm really excited to develop more web pages and apps in the future! I also learned a ton about git and version control, which I know is extremely important to all parts of software development!
