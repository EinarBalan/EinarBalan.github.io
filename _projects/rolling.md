Rolling was one of my first large programming projects. At the time I made it, I was a freshman in highschool and eager to explore programming and computer science. Prior to starting development, I had already had some experience with game mod development, which is a way to inject custom code and assets into existing games and share them with potential players. I was fairly successful with mod development, so I thought the natural next step was to create a game myself.

I opted to create Rolling, a simple infinitely scrolling platformer. Very early on into development I realized I was not a skilled artist, so I struggled a lot with that aspect of development (which would eventually lead me to take on projects that were less artistically intensive). I did enjoy my time developing it, however, and might revisit game development soon!
