Dev Pathways is a web app that aims to compile learning resources for popular technologies and serve them to users in a personalized way. As ACM, the largest computer science club at UCLA, has grown it's become clear that we as an organization need to find a better way to support our new devs, and that's the goal of this app! By establishing a single source for learning all the technologies that the dev teams at ACM use, we hope to make onboarding new devs smoother than ever before.

As product manager of a team of 4, I led weekly standups, assigned tickets on GitHub, and maintained a tight schedule in order to reach the project deadline.
