        in order of most recent:

        <ul>
            <li>Prisoner's Dilemma: the Game!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>currently working on this but very excited! involves philosophy and hardware and cv and game theory :0</li>
                </ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/uclaacm/hack-curriculum/tree/website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM Hack Curriculum Website</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I created a website to accompany the overhaul in curriculum I was proposing! genuinely very proud of this one</li>
                </ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/uclaacm/hack-curriculum/blob/website/archive/stackschool/textbook/src/main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM Hack Textbook</a> </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>not a coding project, but I decided at one point it would be cool to make a textbook so  I did it. it's like 40 pages long but still happy with it</li>
                </ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/yeehaw130/yodel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yodel</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>my capstone project; a social music platform that connects people between Apple Music and Spotify and others, mainly wanted to make it because my girlfriend at the time was an Apple Music user and I was a Spotify user and neither of us had any intention of switching. I also think the idea of having playlists as content (beyond just the music within them) is a huge untapped idea. not all playlists need to be called "vibes" they can be interesting and unique too!</li>
                </ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/EinarBalan/rim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rim</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>hopped on the trend of recreating classic cli apps in rust. remade nano. you may be wondering why did he call it rim if he remade nano? because rano sounds stupid</li>
