# on self checkout
and the downfall of humanity | 4/4/2025 | 10 min

---

I go grocery shopping everyday. for no reason in particular, Ralphs is my store of choice. 

I also visit the self checkout line everyday. at this point, it's automatic. I don't even consider the cashier lines anymore. I'm not sure why I do this. 

I suspect I'm not alone, though. particularly amongst people my age. maybe I'm just projecting my own social anxiety here, but I feel like if you surveyed a group of college students, over half of them would say they prefer self checkout over the cashier. that being said, I have not done that. [someone](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1456821/consumer-preference-for-self-checkout-or-cashier-grocery-store-us/) has,` but I have to make an account to see the results and tbh I'd rather not. I'll just assume that I'm right. 

> brief aside which I learned while I was proofreading this: Ralphs officially does not have a possessive apostrophe. it's named after the founder, George Ralphs, not a guy named Ralph. on the other hand Trader Joe's does have an apostrophe and *is* named after a guy named Joe. crazy. anyways grammar is dumb and I'm sure I missed a ton of other apostrophe's elsewhere

<!-- yea the extra apostrophe above is intentional -->

## the self checkout experience

if I had to guess, a huge reason why self checkout is so popular is because it is so easy and honestly kind of fun. you feel some sense of agency over your own scanning, rather than having to sit there awkwardly while someone else does it for you. I particularly love the voice-over they use at Ralphs that dicates what you're currently scanning. the way she says bananas always makes me laugh. 

the one thing I will say is that the theft detection can be super annoying. the way it works is that the system knows the approximate weight of each item, and if you don't place exactly that weight down in the bagging area after scanning, it'll completely shut down and refuse to let you scan anything else. until an employee begrudgingly comes over and frees you. I'm sure you've experienced this before. to be honest, I don't at all understand how this mitigates theft. like what's the point? if I really wanted to steal something I could just... not scan it. put it right in my pocket. it makes no sense. am I crazy? is there something I'm missing?

it's actually so easy to steal stuff at self checkout that one time I did it by accident. I won't say where and I won't say when, but I will say that I am never going back to this particular store on the off chance I get immediately arrested upon walking in. what happened was I had just finished scanning all my stuff and was about to pay for it when my mom called. of course I had to answer my mom, so I put paying on hold and just talked to her for a bit. she asked me about my day. I struggled to make it somewhat interesting. she nodded and said mhm. the standard mom call. anyways in the excitement, I picked up all my groceries and walked right out of the store, completely forgetting to pay for it. whoops. I only realized as I was waiting at the bus stop with the bus approaching what I had done and obviously at that point it was too late. even if it wasn't, how am I supposed to walk back into a grocery store and tell them that I accidentally stole $100 worth of groceries? I wonder if that happens a lot. anyways I'm getting a bit carried away. 

another reason I think self checkout is so popular is probably social anxiety. it's no secret that gen z is much shyer than earlier generations. a lot of us would just rather avoid that interaction if we can. I'm guilty of it, too. that being said and at the risk of sounding a bit preachy, I'm worried about the precedent that this will (and has) set. 

I understand wanting to avoid the embarrassment that might come from buying certain things. trust me, I do. but I feel like that little interaction with someone you don't know is such an essential part of a community. I would argue it's even more important than interactions with people you're close with. the world might not change too much if all stores completely got rid of cashiers, but what path would that set us on? more and more isolation from any kind of diversity in interaction. only meeting people that look like us and talk like us and limiting our perception of what the world really is more so than it already has been. maybe a bit dramatic, but you get my point. those interactions with strangers are so important for us. 

## why am I thinking about this

this came up during a conversation I was having with a friend a few weeks ago. she told me that one of her hot takes (and she has many) is that she hates self check out. and she laid out her concerns with respect to community, mental health, etc.

she told me there was a study a few years ago where participants were asked to strike up a conversation on their morning commute. most of them were reluctant to do so, and thought it would result in a bunch of awkward moments and rejection, but they actually found that those participants who spoke to strangers around them felt significantly more positive coming out of the commute than those who kept to themselves. I joked that you have to be careful to adhere to the unspoken etiquette of talking to strangers: give them an exit strategy. you don't want to be sitting in an aisle seat blocking someone in at a window. anyways the point still stands. people like talking to people.

here's a link to the [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/) that talks about it. behind a paywall, but I'm sure you can find a way around it. to be so honest, I have not read it yet.

the more that I thought about it, the more I began to question why I always drift towards self checkout. I love talking to strangers. this is something I've found out about myself after years of being approached by randos on the street. and hundred of uber rides.

> my most memorable uber experience was from a dude named Merveil who had a perfect 5 star rating after thousands of rides. an amazing conversationalist and all around cool guy. I asked him a question I ask most of my ubers: "what's the craziest passenger experience you've had?" he was ready for it. no hesitation he starts telling me about this married couple that was headed home after a night out. they were hitting it off so much that the husband told Merveil to wait outside their house once they arrived so he could get him a tip. his wife stayed inside. rather than bringing back a tip, the husband came back and asked him to write down his number so they could "meet up." not in a platonic way. absolutely apalling behaviour

## talking to strangers

there's just something very liberating about talking to someone who you will never see ever again. I almost find it easier to talk to strangers than to people I'm super close with. it's a clean slate. no expectations.  I am notoriously terrible about reaching out to people. everyone close to me in my life has complained about it at some point. it's a work in progress and something I think about a lot. part of me wonders whether the energy I spend talking to strangers is better placed with my loved ones. the other part pushes that thought down as far into my subconscious as possible.

lately I've been trying to say hi to more people I pass on the street. not everyone is super receptive to it, but I can tell a lot of people do appreciate it. not super common in LA. admittedly though, I only do this when I'm hanging out with other people. I'm not sure why. 

my sister's husband is the king of talking to strangers. dude can literally become someone's best friend within ten minutes of meeting them, only to say goodbye forever in the next five. I'm not quite there yet, but I aspire to that level.

anyways this is all to say that I will be doing my best to unlearn my automatic self checkout problem. my first day was today. I mean, ok, I went to Trader Joe's which doesn't even have self checkout, but it still counts I think. I got two things of pizza dough and some uncured pepperoni. the lady at the register gave me a huge smile and the guy at the bagging area complimented the shrimp fried rice sticker on my water bottle. it's a good start.
