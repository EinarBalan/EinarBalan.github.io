        - everyone has a slightly different version of english that they internalize
        - ling 120b, one of the most common things my professor said was *most* people find this ungrammatical, but not all
        - language shifts, evolves
        - prescriptivism is dumb
        - as long as you understand the intent
        - that being said its not wrong to prefer certain dialects over others
        - just like art is subjective, so is 
        - my favorite dialect is person raised in a british family who was raised in the valley in LA and so for some words they sound very british and for others they sound very valley and you're always waiting in anticipation to find out which one you're going to get
