<p>the best worst author | 8/26/24 | 6 min</p>
<hr />
<p>this morning I woke up very early for no reason at all and, after failing to go back to sleep for about fifteen minutes, I decided to go for a walk to Sculpture Garden. I brought my book.</p>
<p>right now I'm reading Men Without Women by Haruki Murakami, a collection of short stories which are loosely related to the title. the story today was called <em>Kino</em>, after the main character, and I finished all of it in one sitting. It's pretty short, at around nine thousand words. I got a bit emotional as I was finishing it, which is pretty rare for me when I'm reading. you should <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/kino-haruki-murakami">give it a read</a> before going on because I'll pretty much spoil the entire punchline.</p>
<p>very generally, it's about a man named <em>Kino</em> that comes home a day early from a business trip, only to find his coworker in bed with his wife. he immediately files for divorce, quits his job, and opens a bar. the story follows his various interactions with customers at the bar (which is simply named "Kino"). </p>
<p>at one point his ex-wife comes to the bar with divorce papers. here's the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I need to apologize to you,” his wife said finally.</em></p>
  <p><em>“For what?” Kino asked.</em> </p>
  <p><em>“For hurting you,” she said. “You were hurt, a little, weren’t you?”</em></p>
  <p><em>“I suppose so,” Kino said, after giving it some thought. “I’m human, after all. I was hurt. But whether it was a lot or a little I can’t say.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kino is implying that it affected him, but not all that much. </p>
<p>working at the bar, Kino makes unexpected friends, gets into conflict, and even takes one of his customers to bed. the bar is the ultimate distraction. he isn't affected by the divorce simply because he doesn't have the bandwidth to be. eventually though, it catches up to him. </p>
<p>near the end of the story, he's haunted by literal demons. he hides from them, retreating under the covers of a hotel bed, but they won't stop knocking at his door. eventually they move to the window and he's forced to confront them.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>As if luring him deeper into a suggestive maze, this ever-regular beat. Tap tap, tap tap, then once more—tap tap. “Don’t look away, look right at it,” someone whispered in his ear. “This is what your heart looks like.”</em></p>
  <p><em>The willow branches swayed in the early-summer breeze. In a small dark room, somewhere inside Kino, a warm hand was reaching out to him. Eyes shut, he felt that hand on his, soft and substantial. He’d forgotten this, had been apart from it for far too long. Yes, I am hurt. Very, very deeply. He said this to himself. And he wept.</em></p>
  <p><em>All the while the rain did not let up, drenching the world in a cold chill.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>he finally admits to himself, that he's been hurt. to me, it's a story about processing grief. and the danger of putting it off. grief doesn't go away until you confront it. and the longer you wait, the harder it will hit.</p>
<p>the story hit very hard for me because I've gone through something very similar. fairly recently actually. I mean I'm sure it's pretty common. people trying their hardest not to admit to themselves that they're hurting, only to be struck with an unbearable wave of pain. is this too real? I don't know maybe.</p>
<p>anyways, I bring this all up to say that I really enjoyed the story. one of my favorites from Murakami. when I read stuff like this, I want to love Murakami. I want to say he's my favorite author. the problem is, there's so much goofy shit that I have to look past. and from what I can tell this is a fairly common sentiment.</p>
<h2 id="murakamimoments">murakami moments</h2>
<p>if you've read Murakami, you know exactly what I'm talking about. there are a ton of tropes that he uses, intentionally or not, that genuinely make me roll my eyes. if you've gone on r/menwriting women, it's a lot of that kind of thing. he's featured on there quite a bit. I don't know what it is, but he just cannot resist describing a woman's breasts. nine out of ten times, if he introduces a female character, he will describe her breasts. it's a bit ridiculous. </p>
<p>one of the worst offenders of this is the book 1Q84. I read it while I was alone in Portugal for two weeks (long story), and I remember a scene where one of the protagonists is describing her friend who had passed away. she talks about how much she misses them and describes how they died in gruesome detail. and then she says this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>A troubled young woman walking toward the abyss of destruction. She had had beautiful breasts as well.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>like… come on. so unnecessary. it adds nothing to the story. if anything, it pulls you out of it. and there are so many examples of this. but this isn't as bad as it gets. he has scenes that sexualize minors… it's bad. I don't even want to really get into it. </p>
<p>there's also the trope of the main character being kind of a loser who has no personality whatsoever and yet every female character he meets wants to have sex with him. another weird one. he also does this thing where characters think they're in love, but they barely know the person (but maybe this is intentional. I don't know. there's really no way to tell. I remember when I read Norwegian Wood, which was my first Murakami, I rationalized all the flaws by saying they were intentional. and that's how I justified liking the book so much to myself. but it's pretty clear after reading some more Murakami that he just can't help it). anyways I could go on about all the tropes, but I think you get the idea.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>a brief aside:</strong> I think the reason these tropes keep popping up is largely a result of Murakami's work ethic. I've heard that he'll wake up at five AM every morning and write ten pages, without exceptions. this seems admirable until you realize that's only possible if he is writing down basically every thought as it comes. no planning whatsoever. I'm sure he edits after the fact, but the foundation is set. just my guess.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="whydoikeepcomingback">why do I keep coming back?</h2>
<p>okay so clearly there is a lot to dislike about Murakami. and yet I've read five of his books and several of his short stories now. what brings me back everytime?</p>
<p>I really enjoy the way he sets a scene. he always very meticulously describes the setting, what people are wearing, how they're feeling, what's playing in the background. but it doesn't feel excessive. a lot of the time, when I'm reading a book I can't really picture what's going on. maybe others can but I struggle with it a bit. but there's truly something special about his descriptions that paint a very vivid picture. </p>
<p>I also find that a lot of his books always have me feeling very emotional after I read them. maybe I'm laughing at how ridiculous some of it is or maybe I'm crying because something hit too close to home, but I'm feeling something. that's the goal with art, right? in that respect he definitely succeeds. </p>
<p>in the end, I'm willing to appreciate Murakami's work, despite all of its flaws. honestly the flaws are almost welcome at this point. it makes it more interesting. I think it's really important to learn to appreciate things in spite of their flaws. this sounds cliche, but nothing's perfect. nobody is. and even if they were, perfection is boring. </p>
<p>I used to beat myself up a lot when I made mistakes. a lot of negative self talk. but I'm trying not to do that anymore. I'm definitely not perfect. but beating yourself up when you make a mistake only makes things worse. a mistake is an opportunity for growth. and that's a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>so I'm not going to beat up Murakami either. or anyone for that matter. </p>
<p>I give <em>Kino</em> a 9.5/10.</p></article>
