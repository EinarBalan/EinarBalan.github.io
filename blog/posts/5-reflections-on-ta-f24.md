# on a quarter spent taing
and a naive approach to fixing education | 12/17/2024 | 22 min

---

I got back my TA evaluations this morning and I'm not even gonna lie I cried a little. not because they were bad, but because they were really, really good. 

I mean, I knew I was doing a good job. in general, I find that I'm a pretty good judge of myself. it's just nice to be appreciated after putting in so much effort. I don't know, I don't fully understand why I cried, but that is one theory. 

here is a snippet (and one of the nicest things a person I do not know has ever said about me):

> "As a third-year, I have had many TAs to date. However, I say without exaggeration that Einar has been the best TA I have had so far. Although it is his first year as a master's student, his slides are incredibly well-made, and he is hugely passionate about helping us succeed. The balance between content review, practice, and project hints is perfect - a quick review followed by nuanced practice, and lots of project guidance without giving answers away - and even though we don't often have time to cover all the slides in class, I have benefitted greatly from them on their own after discussion as well. I hope in future quarters that he continues with his Kahoot style questions and exam-prep Kahoots! Einar is highly approachable and receptive to feedback, and I am immensely grateful to have had him as a TA.
>
> (On a serious note, I personally believe he deserves a pay raise! He truly goes above and beyond to help his students.)"

in the back of my mind, I was thinking to myself "hmm maybe they're just saying nice things because they like me as a person, but in reality they think there are certain things I could have done better" but I don't think that is a very productive thought to have so I will ignore it. anyways I am not writing this to brag about how good of a teacher I am, I'm writing this for three reasons:

1. to reflect on noteworthy moments from the past ten weeks
2. to think about what I could have done better and what I did well
3. to diagnose what I think is the problem with education in America 

that is a lot of ground to cover and this is gonna be very stream of consciousness rambling because I am meant to be on break right now but anyways enjoy 👍

> also a quick note: I debated whether or not I should include the intro above because from a certain perspective it could be seen as too self congratulatory/arrogant, but the more that I think about it the less I care lmao. people should be able to freely talk about the things they do well just like they are able to talk about the things they do poorly. and anyways I'm sure most people won't actually care, but I do want to at least acknowledge that. ok moving on. 

## the shy pooper

my very first interaction with one student, I was walking towards the exit after wrapping up. this student began walking with me and asked me about my work experience and recounted his, including a detailed description of the many OAs (online assessments) he was currently doing.

on its own this is totally fine, although I would never do it and I would probably never be friends with someone that did it. but I get that the culture surrounding CS kind of encourages this. I get it. 

anyways, I was getting a bit tired of the conversation and if I am being very honest I did not want to walk all the way back towards my apartment entertaining it, so I pulled my tried and true, "I need to pee" move. 

he approached the door and as he was opening it, I kind of held back.

*me*: "I'm gonna go to the bathroom."

*him*: "oh... ok. I don't need to go."

*me*: "oh. well I'm gonna go."

*him*: "oh.. ok. well I'm not going with you."

*me*: "uhhh ok... yeah I know. I wasn't asking you to come."

*him*: "oh. ok. it just seemed like you were."

*me*: "ok well bye see you later!"

and then I walked away as quickly as I possibly could, dying inside a little more with each step. I still don't fully understand why he thought I was inviting him to come to the bathroom with me?? was it my tone? the expression on my face? I genuinely could not tell you. 

anways the story does not end there. also before I go on I should say, this guy is actually very nice I like him a lot. I think maybe he's just a weird mix of awkward and confident which honestly I relate to a bit. he also sent me a very nice voice message at the end of the quarter (on discord). ok that being said let's keep going. 

after the last discussion, we held a little pizza party. this is something I try to do every quarter I teach if the vibe is right because I used to love when we had pizza parties in elementary school and middle school and I think fun things like that are one thing that college classes are missing. $90 worth of pizza. 4 large. 1 cheese, 1 pepperoni, 1 sausage, 1 spinach banana pepper sausage oregano. unfortunately it was not enough for everyone but anyways it was a good time. I was talking with some students, when the student from earlier approached us. he waited for the right moment and said, "can I tell you a story, Einar?"

"sure."

"it's a little weird, I don't know if I should tell it."

"well that's kind of a given with you, you should tell it." 

"ok... well this is the story of how you almost made me poop my pants"

"oh... okay. wait are you being serious"

"so one day after discussion I really had to poop, right? so I went into the bathroom and went into one of the stalls and sat down and got ready to go. but then I noticed your shoes in the stall next to mine. and I just could not go knowing that you were in the next stall, it just like would not happen. and so I had to get up and go find another bathroom in the building but I couldn't find one for like 10 minutes and I was so close but I finally found one and went and... yeah cut it very very close."

"why didn't you just go in the stall next to mine"

"I don't know I just couldn't"

"oh ok I'm sorry that that happened. next time don't be shy"

everyone around us thought his story was very funny. I thought so too. mainly because of how unexpected it was, but I should have known considering how we first met. anyways there is no real point or insight to this story I just thought it was funny. I guess one insight I can pull out of it is to always treat everyone well even when you think they are a bit weird upon first meeting them 👍 but yeah he's a cool guy I like him. there are more stories I could tell about him (one of them concerning the professor who taught the class), but I will leave them for another time.

## academic mccarthyism

ok this one is a bit more serious I apologize for the abrupt change in tone. another thing that happened was that a *lot* of people were accused of cheating this quarter. at least it felt like a lot to me. maybe this is normal. anyway I have two particular cases I want to talk about because I found them meaningful. 

both of them involve students from my discussion who participated a decent amount and who I knew by name. what I found interesting was how each of them chose to handle their accusation. to be clear, it was not me who accused them. I tried to stay as far away from the cheating stuff as possible because it made me very uncomfortable. but I recognize that I was still somewhat responsible for their accusation.

anyways, starting with the first student. she was always very active in my discussion. constantly made an effort to participate and I would say she had a very positive impact on the vibes overall. anyways. after the midterm, I noticed she had one of the lower scores in the class. this was a surprise to me considering how active she was. but I get it. things happen, life gets in the way. grades don't matter anyway. at the start of discussion, I gave a whole rant about my philosophy on grades (particularly how they don't matter and are bad measurements of learning; more on this later) and made it clear that if anyone needed extra help I would be happy to provide it. which I think is the bare minimum that a teacher should do. 

she approached me after discussion and told me about how she always makes an effort in class (which was definitely true) but has been really struggling—particularly with the projects and the midterm. I did my best to reassure her that things would be fine and I promised that if she ever needed any extra help or had any questions that I would be there.

the problem was, at this point I already knew that she had been accused of cheating. she didn't yet. I had never been in a situation like this before. I felt super conflicted because on one hand I wanted to believe that she was innocent and was truly doing her best. but everything the other teaching staff was saying made it seem like the case was pretty much closed and that she was guilty. it definitely didn't help that when I tried to help her debug her project code, large portions of it were clearly generated by chatgpt and she couldn't explain it to me. I still wanted to believe she was innocent though. anyways, I didn't say anything to her about the accusation. 

about a week later, I ran into her on my way to office hours. I waved and smiled and she kind of ignored me. there was no way she didn't see me because I was like right next to her. I figured she must have found out about the cheating thing. I don't blame her. she must have thought I had something to do with it. this was all confirmed a few hours later as I met with the rest of the teaching team. I felt really bad about the situation and something didn't feel right. I couldn't explain it though.

anyways that's the first case.

the second case involved another student who I knew by name and who was fairly active. this one is particularly interesting because right before the midterm I had joked about showing him the exam so he could get a head start. anyways he took the midterm. didn't do amazing but not terrible. a few weeks later he comes to my office hours and tells me he got accused of cheating. which I had no idea about. no one had said anything to me. 

he was adamant that he did not cheat and started showing me the question he was accused of cheating on. I tried to calm him down, and reassure him everything would be fine (even though I was not sure if it would be). I took an unbiased look at the question and told him as honestly as I could that it did not look good. he gave me his explanation and walked me through his thought process, but if I am being honest it was still a bit shaky. I gave him the best advice I could to try to get through it. I reassured him that the consequences for first time offenders weren't that severe. at the very least he would not get kicked out of school. I told him what I knew about the meeting with the dean (which was not very much). I tried to help as much as possible because I wanted to believe that he was innocent. he seemed like a decent guy. 

he thanked me and went on his way. I didn't see him again until the final exam. he handed me his paper and smiled and said "thank you." apparently he had been exonerated. whether or not he was actually guilty is another question, but still. I think it was the right move. not worth ruining someone's life over a single copied answer. I found out later that the other student was determined to be innocent too. I have not seen her since she ignored me at the crosswalk. hopefully she's doing alright.

anyways this turned out to be quite a bit longer than I thought it would be. I hope I am not making a mistake by talking about this publicly. I think it should be fine. my insight from the two situations: it's important to communicate. if you're in a tough situation, be like the second student and confront it head on. especially if you're innocent. I will never know whether the two actually cheated, but it is very clear to me that the guy's response was miles better. to be clear, I'm not blaming the girl at all. it was a tough situation. am I making this more dramatic than it should be? maybe, but I feel like this same line of thinking is applicable to more serious issues too. on that note, I'll say it's important to be trusting (when appropriate). give people the benefit of the doubt. I would much rather a few cheaters slip through the cracks than accidentally ruin someone's life for no reason. also, I should note that I don't blame anyone from the teaching team for the situation either. they're just doing their jobs. this is another point I will touch on again in a bit. but that is all for the cheating stuff. yeehaw

## misc details that I find meaningful

ok some final little details that don't warrant a full story, but I think are interesting and want to mention:
1. there was a dude who went to my office hours nearly every week and at first was very standoffish and avoidant and (at times) a bit rude? but by the end of the quarter it was clear to me I had won him over which was a very nice feeling
2. at the end of my fourth or fifth discussion, everyone in the class applauded??? usually the applause is reserved for the last discussion but I guess I did something really right during the fourth. if I remember right people had found one of the jokes in my slides pretty funny so maybe that was it?? I will tell myself that was it because it makes me happy
3. at one point during the later half of the quarter I was walking past a group of students who I had just talked to and I don't think they saw me coming and I overheard one of them say "I have never seen him up close oh my god" and then as I walked away they said "oh my god he just walked by" LMAO
4. also for whatever reason so many people kept asking me if I play brawlstars. I had no idea brawlstars was so popular. maybe it is undergoing a resurgence. at one point some dude's supercell intro music went off while I was in the middle of introducing a problem. anyways I always responded with the story about how I got my dad into clash of clans and how he still plays (I think) and has far surpassed me
5. I held office hours at sculpture garden which everyone told me was a bad idea but I did it anyway because I like sculpture garden. anyway turns out it was truly a bad idea because it gets chilly in late fall and pinecones fall out of the trees and narrowly avoid hitting people's heads whoops. will make a note of that for next time

## what I did well

ok moving on to what I think I did well this quarter. I'm not going to spend too much time here. first the thing I'm most proud of and what is always my first goal as a teacher: creating a sense of community in the classroom. people knew each other. they talked to each other. most importantly, people who had never spoken before the class got to know each other. they made new friends. that's so important to me. I genuinely feel like I have failed if that doesn't happen.

I also feel like I was very engaging and got pretty good at presenting problems that are both relevant and interesting. and also I was very approachable and relatable 👍

also I should mention I feel like I maintained a very good balance of being nice and empathetic and also knowing when to put my foot down. like I got a lot of emails with requests for extensions, accomodations, etc. and I feel like I got pretty good at having a fair response to them. (many grandparents died this quarter; this is something I would put in a footnote if I could do that)

## what I didn't do well

ok. I definitely could have done some things better.

most importantly: creating a sense of community in the classroom. wait was this not included as something I did well?? yeah it was. but there were certain parts that I think I could have done better. despite my efforts, there were still some people who preferred to sit 10 rows back, far away from anyone else in the class. there were still people who I feel I didn't help as much as I could have. there are people who felt like I wasn't paying attention to them as much as I could have. I'm not going to beat myself up over it, but it's definitely something work on.

another thing. at the start of the quarter, I was absolutely atrocious at responding to people who answered a question wrong. you would think I would have gotten better at this by now considering I spent a year doing this every week as an LA, but no. maybe I was just rusty at the start of the quarter. during the very first discussion, someone raised their hand and answered a question and I swear to god my response was, "are you joking?" I wish I was kidding. very quickly it became clear he was not joking and I felt so bad. we kind of laughed it off but god damn... I cannot be doing that. I got better later on in the quarter though.

also I hope to get better at helping people in office hours. often students would come with ultra specific questions about the projects or the homeworks and I wouldn't be able to answer them as well as I would hope. not even just for the debugging questions which are always going to be tough, but for conceptual stuff. I think part of this was just that I didn't have as much time to prep for the projects as I had hoped. that being said, considering that I didn't even get to implement projects 3 and 4 myself, I did a decent job answering questions surrounding them. but can definitely do better.

also I think there was a bit of a drop off in slide quality later on in the quarter. mainly because I had less time to make them. that being said the slides are still pretty good overall I think.

another important one: I need to get much better at balancing work and my relationships. not going to go into too much detail on that one here, but I think it is pretty self explanatory.

## how to fix education

ok just to round everything out: a very brief and naive approach to fixing the education system in America. brief because this is already getting way too long. word vomit for real. maybe I will do another post going in more depth but there are a few problems with education that I have noticed that seem to be systematic. I should preface by saying I have exactly zero hours of research on this, have read no papers on the subject, and am mainly going off of vibes. anyways. 

> also I should say, when I refer to "all people" in the next few paragraphs, I don't really mean all people. I just mean a decent number who I have noticed in my experience. I've also noticed a lot of people who these generalizations do not describe.

first problem: a lack of empathy. a lot of instructors have a lack of empathy for students and a lot of students have a lack of empathy for instructors. it's obvious why this is. I know a few people who are both instructors and students and they still are totally unempathetic when it comes to the role opposite their current position. it blows my mind. I am aware this sounds so obvious but it is genuinely a problem.

another (obvious) problem: education is too "grade-centric." all people care about is their grade. they don't care about what they have learned. they don't care about personal growth. they care about their grade. obviously this is antithetical to the goal of education. and this is a deep rooted problem. we start giving grades as early as elementary school and expect students to not become obsessed with them. I was obssessed with them at one point. granted, grades are necessary in some situations. but I think in the majority of cases the way they are measured right now is not good. and I think the impact it has on intrinsic student motivation is horrible. probably not a controversial take. I think school should be more project & presentation focused. huge emphasis on presentation. I might be biased but I think the single most important skill you can have as as person is presenting in an interesting, engaging way. it's clear to me after a quarter of TA seminar (in which prospective TAs present on any technical topic they want) that most people are not good at this. I think the world would be a better place if they were. 

another problem: people don't like people who try. this is probably not true of everyone, but it is something I have noticed in the culture at UCLA and in high school. if I'm being honest, it is something I have noticed about myself at times too. think about that guy who always raises his hand in your class. how do you feel about him? for me, the immediate answer is usually dislike. and that is not good. we should be celebrating people who are engaged. people who try. people who aren't scared what others think. those are the best kinds of people. on second thought maybe this is more of a personal issue and isn't broadly applicable lol. I don't know, if you got this far let me know. do you get annoyed at people who participate a lot in class? and if so why?

## living up to the name

overall, I'm really happy with how this quarter went. I feel like I have grown a lot in many ways. I feel more confident than ever. happier than ever. healthier than ever. I still have bad days, but I pick myself up more quickly than ever.

it's my birthday as I'm writing this. this is going to sound corny, but usually on my birthday I don't feel any different. I don't feel like I have changed at all in the year that passed and I certainly don't feel any older. but this year is different. 23 feels different. I feel like an actual adult now. everyone I have told this to has laughed at me. but I really do feel something. I can't quite single it out. but it's a good something. I feel good. happy birthday to me.
