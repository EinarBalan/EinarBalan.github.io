# on fake names
my name is Ross | 8/16/2024 | 5 min

---

whenever I'm at a restaurant and they ask me my name, I always say Ross. Ross is not my name. no one has ever called me Ross. 

up until I was eighteen or nineteen, I always said Einar. most of the time it would be met with question marks and would require me to repeat myself two or three times. I mean, I get it. Einar is not an easy name for the average American to say. pretty uncommon here! so I decided to make it easier on everyone and just say Ross instead.

at first I used "Bob Ross," or "Bobross" if only a first name was allowed, which I may have stolen from my girlfriend at the time. to be fair I think she also stole it from another one of her friends. 

> side note: I truly believe every good idea starts off as completely unoriginal and gradually takes on its own personality over time. 

> another side note: I wish I could make footnotes on here, but for now I am stuck with whatever this is.

anyways, as much as I enjoyed hearing people call out Bob Ross's name, I decided it was a bit too on the nose. so I shortened it to Ross. I considered using Bob but that is like the quintessential fake name. and to be honest I'm not really sure why. like is anyone actually named Bob in 2024? how many babies born in the last 12 months were named Bob? I have no idea and I'm too lazy to look it up. probably not a lot though. 

so I went with Ross. 

## doubts

sometimes I question whether I'm doing something wrong. I mean I am technically lying, but I'm not doing it with malicious intent, right? another part of me feels bad because I'm kinda invalidating the cultural significance of my name and my heritage etc etc. but like... let's be real. I'm just ordering a chicken sandwich and waffle fries. Chic-fil-a isn't what I would call a cultural hotspot. 

in other contexts, I think it's super important to stick to my own name and that others stick to theirs as well. and that we all learn the REAL names, regardless of how hard they might be for us to pronounce. I mean, yes, it might be a little more effort but I think it pays off a lot. I definitely sympathize with people who prefer to take on nicknames (obviously). that moment when someone mispronounces your name *again* after you've corrected them for the 3rd time is super painful. but I think its important. everyone deserves to be recognized, and getting names right is the first step! in particular, when I'm teaching I try my absolute hardest to remember as many names as I possibly can and I encourage others in the class to do the same. I think learning names is the first step towards community building, and that's what I always strive for in the classroom.

in the classroom. I don't care if people get my name right at Chic-fil-a. just call me Ross. I sometimes catch myself introducing myself as Ross to people who I know I definitely will not be interacting with again just because I'm not in the best mood and I want to avoid the hassle of correcting them, but I'm trying not to do that anymore. it's a bit mean. working on it! 

## pressure

one time I was ordering food on campus at UCLA, at Ackerman. I think I went with the intention of getting a burrito off of the value menu at Rubios, but once I saw the line I quickly abandoned that in favor of Veggie Grill, which had no line at all. I ordered my "chick'n tenders" (as a brief aside, I didn't even notice that everything on the menu was plant based the first time I got Veggie Grill. I'm not sure if that says something about me or about Veggie Grill) and when the lady at the counter asked me my name I told her Ross. 

"Russ?"

"no, Ross."

"oh, Ross. is that your real name?"

"uhh yeah."

"oh ok. do you know Ross on instagram?"

"no but I know Ross from friends"

"oh ok. Ross on instagram is pretty cool you should check him out. @ross"

"ok I'll check him out. have a good day"

I'm still not sure why she asked me if Ross was my real name. but she seemed to not believe me. maybe I hesitated before I said it. or maybe I just don't look like a Ross. I'm not sure. I checked out @ross on instagram. the page doesn't exist. she's really nice though. she still works at Veggie Grill and I see her every now and then. she doesn't ask me if Ross is my real name anymore.

## acceptance

admittedly, when I was younger I didn't really like the name Einar. for a lot of the reasons I've mentioned here. it just was a bit of a hassle, especially amongst a classroom of 12 year olds. but I've grown to really appreciate it. it's nice to always be the only Einar around. I've never even met another Einar (though I do know they exist -- I think there was a Swedish rapper named Einar who died in a gang conflict. which sucks. who knew Sweden had gangs?? not me. this is something I would put in a footnote) so its nice to be unique. and I definitely stand out. my name at least. 

according to [thebump.com](https://www.thebump.com/b/einar-baby-name), Einar means "lone warrior" or "battle leader" and is often used to refer to Norse warriors who were destined for Valhalla. that's pretty darn cool I think. its the 8,298th most popular name in the United States. so thanks to my dad for naming me Einar. and thank god I'm not named Boris (which is what my mom wanted to name me). 

but I'm still going to say my name is Ross at Chic-fil-a.
