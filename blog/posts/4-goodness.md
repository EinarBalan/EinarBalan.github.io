# on inherent goodness
naive or necessary? | 9/6/24 | 16 minutes

---

about two years ago, I went through one of the most difficult periods of my life. I live a fairly privileged life, so this isn't saying too much, but at the time it felt like it was the end of the world. 

I was alone in Portugal living in a run down, two bedroom Airbnb. my checked bags had gotten lost somewhere along the way from LA. the plan had been for me to meet up with my parents, and we would spend my winter break hitting all the touristy spots in their new home country. unfortunately, they ran into some VISA issues and they had to delay their trip. 

I didn't speak any Portuguese, I knew nobody, and I had none of my stuff. I was completely on my own. 

I distinctly remember at one point early on getting a grand total of 5 hours of sleep over the course of three or four days, partly due to jetlag and partly due to the neighbors upstairs partying unceasingly until four or five AM every night. most days the only people I spoke to in person were my uber eats drivers. 

I'm making it sound like being in Portugal was the root of all my problems, but in reality I had been going through a fairly hard time for quite a while at that point. I was going through the first serious break up of my life and was having trouble processing it. I never experienced a lot of rejection growing up, so it hit quite hard when it finally happened. 

but being alone in Portugal wasn't all bad. for one, it gave me a lot of time to think. in a world where everyone is constantly fighting for your attention, some time alone with your thoughts is pretty valuable. 

I thought about a lot of things over those few weeks, but one question kept coming up: *am I a good person?*

it sounds a bit silly to me now, but I was genuinely questioning whether I deserved all the misfortune that had been happening up to that point. it felt like there was no other explanation. I was being punished. 

I was a pretty good kid growing up. I got good grades, tried to follow all the rules, and tried to lift up the people around me. even when I was playing video games and there were branching paths, I always chose the good path. 

and yet I couldn't shake the feeling that I had gone wrong somewhere along the way.

## redemption arc

I wrestled with that question for most of the trip. luckily things got better once the rest of my family showed up. I had a lot of fun wandering the streets of Alfama in Lisbon looking for stray cats to feed and visiting literal fairy tale castles in Sintra with the people I love so much. but I still couldn't shake that question. 

which is why when I came upon *Humankind: A Hopeful History* at the airport bookstore on the way back home, I felt compelled to buy it. at its core—and the reason I was so drawn to it—the book attempts to argue that humans are inherently a force for good. 

to that point I had been exposed to so many depressing, nihilistic perspectives (many of which were my own) that an argument for the opposite was a breath of fresh air. it brought up a lot of points that I wholeheartedly believe in to this day.

it introduced me to the concept of non-complementary reactions: treating people who may have wronged you with kindness. and the concept of nocebo: that those around you will only be as good as you believe them to be (which is a bit of a silly name but there is no doubt in my mind that it's true). both of these are core tenets of how I live my life today.

it also brings up the idea of comraderie: most people just want to fit in with their group and will do whatever they can to that end—even things that are morally questionable. nobody wakes up and thinks to themselves, *I want to be a villain today.* we long to be loved. sometimes we make mistakes. or do bad things out of desperation. but that doesn't make us bad at our core. the vast majority of people are like this. 

most importantly, it brought me a step closer to answering the question that had plagued me in Portugal. and it set me along the path to becoming a much better version of myself.

## doubts
whether or not the book is entirely accurate is a question I still struggle with. some might see it as naive and overly reliant on anecdotes. maybe there's some merit to that argument. 

I've also realized it's important not to let your faith in people cloud your judgement. you can't let people take advantage of you, no matter how hopeful you are that they mean well. 

I remember one day I went to my favorite professor's adivising hours on Zoom. I'd never actually spoken to him one-on-one or even taken one of his classes, but I did audit his Theoretical Computer Science class and absolutely loved it. he has such a talent for communicating his passion and is overall such a ray of sunshine. I always left his classes in a better mood than when I came in. one of my inspirations for sure. 

anyways we ended up having quite a lengthy conversation. we covered a lot of topics including some advice for teaching, how to maintain a "sunny disposition," and an assortment of other things. most relevant here was our discussion of the Prisoner's Dilemma. I said offhand that I truly believed the world would be a better place if people were more open and trusting of strangers, rather than immediately assuming the worst of everyone. he pushed back on this though, which makes sense considering his field of work. he's the director of a cybersecurity lab at UCLA. he cautioned me against being too trusting because there are always people out there who aim to take advantage of that trust. and he's probably right. but I still believe the vast majority of people in the world have no interest in that. 

> side note: we also got into some light game theory, which is something I find so interesting and I want to do more research about. you should watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM) from Veritasium if you're interested in the subject.

> as another aside, who's to say what is morally good and what isn't? is it possible to definitively say that something is absolutely good? it's clear that things are probably more complicated than that. everything in perspective. my sister's husband and I recently had a conversation about exactly this. he believes morality is on a spectrum. but that's a whole other rabbit hole that I don't want to get into here.

this all seems to point to the fact that humans are not inherently good and that we're simply a product of our environment. but this feels very unsatisfying to me. I don't want to leave it at that. it feels incomplete. I'll keep pushing for the idea that (the majority of) humans are inherently good because that's what makes me happy.

## how to be a good person

that being said, I recognize that sometimes things get in the way and we're not able to be our best selves. here are some things that I've realized have a huge impact on my ability to be my best (some of which hopefully generalize beyond me):

1. **DRINK WATER**. this is the one that has had the most drastic impact on me. I realized after an optometrist appointment at U See LA in Ackerman that I was severly dehydrated. after I started paying attention to how much water I drank, it was insane how much better I felt. this is not hard to do, but it's easy to overlook.

2. **EAT BLUEBERRIES**. I love blueberries. I feel so much better after I have some. I don't know if it's the antioxidants or the vitamin C or just the sugar, but there's something about it. find your blueberries and consume regularly.

3.  **DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL**. in other words avoid bad stress. this seems obvious but it's harder than you would think.

4. **SURROUND YOURSELF WITH UNCONDITIONAL LOVE**. the people who you don't feel like you need to put on a show for. the people who are comfortable in silence. who will stick around even at your worst and try to help you through it.

5. **SURROUND YOURSELF WITH HONEST PEOPLE**. usually this group is a clean intersection of the last group. you need to be told when you're wrong or you'll keep making the same mistakes. 

6. **EXERCISE VIGOROUSLY**. I always feel better after a nice run or a hard workout. something to do with dopamine I think. I've been told not everyone feels this way. it's probably an acquired taste. but it absolutely works in my experience.

7. **SLEEP CONSISTENTLY**. another obvious one. you need to rest to be your best. a bit less obvious is that you need to rest at the same times everyday. set a bedtime and stick to it. I think this is a huge part of why I was feeling so bad in Portugal.

8. **DO WHAT YOU LOVE**. find the things that you're passionate about. for me it's teaching. music. writing. this is a huge part of being happy even when you're alone (which I know is very hard for a lot of people I have spoken to). this is not easy to do, especially with the popularity of things like TikTok, but it's essential imo.

9. **LEARN TO LOVE THINGS YOU'RE BAD AT**. I love guitar. I'm not very good at it. for now. I fell in love with crosswords a year ago and I was atrocious at them. now I'm not bad at all. eventually the things you love and are bad at just become the things you love. 

10. **BE SOCIAL**. this one's obvious. but its a hard one for me. sometimes I'd rather just be alone in my room. it takes less effort. but I never regret going out and I never regret putting myself out there. that being said, it's also important to be ok with being alone. it's a difficult balancing act. but it pays off.

11. **TRY NEW THINGS**. most of the time when I try something new I don't like it. but that's part of the fun. at least now you never need to try that thing again. on the other hand, you might find your new favorite thing.

12. **ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE BORED**. don't be that guy that pulls their phone out at the urinal. just let yourself be alone in your thoughts. it's not a coincidence that a lot of people's best ideas come to them in the shower. you can have that more often if you keep your phone in your pocket.

13. **DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP**. you're going to make mistakes. what matters is how you learn from them. a bit cliche, but true.

14. **BE CREATIVE**. I'm not happy unless I'm making something. even better if its something I'm proud of. I don't know if this is something everybody feels, but I think it's worth mentioning. 

15. **TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING**. get yourself a pet. or if you're not ready for that get yourself a plant. anything that puts you in a position of responsibility over another living thing. it's insane how effective this is.

16. **DO GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF DOING GOOD**. this is one of the most important ones. don't do good things because you want something in return. just do good for the sake of it. talk to that stranger who seems lonely. smile at the guy running past you. empathize with that student who is struggling. it'll pay off.

somewhere along the way this also turned into a "how to be happy" list. although I suppose the two have a lot of overlap. if you can't tell, this is something I think about a lot. I don't claim to have all the answers, but this is what works for me.

all that being said, it's super imporant to understand that you're going to have bad days. you mess up or you feel like you can't get anything right. when you feel like you're not the best version of yourself. that's ok. it's bound to happen. one mistake doesn't make you a bad person. neither do five. or a hundred. 

I'll probably never know whether all humans are inherently good. but I do know that that's what I strive for. and I know for a fact that everyone has the capacity for good. 

for me, that's good enough.
