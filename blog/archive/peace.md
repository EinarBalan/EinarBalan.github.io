and men who scroll at the urinal | 6/21/2025 | X min

note: I didn't finish this post and I don't intend to bc it was gonna be a lil too real i think

today is june 21st, 2025. six days ago I graduated (at possibly the most underwhelming graduation ceremony of all time) and now I'm on a flight back home from Newark to LAX. I just got done watching the man in front of me watch red hulk beat the shit out of captain america 2 on his iPad Mini and as the movie credits rolled I realized I haven't had a single interesting thought in the last five days. I've been on a cruise with my family to Nova Scotia. that tends to happen when I do things like that *(1)*. anyways I have decided that I will attempt to squeeze at least a single thought out of my brain and the best way to do that is to do this. 

something I find super interesting is how people on planes choose to spend their time. take for example the guy sitting in front of me. he downloaded a single movie onto his iPad and watched it from beginning to end and has since moved on to the book he downloaded onto his phone. this is probably one of the more common archetypes. there are also the sleepers who pass out the second they sit down. the mobile gamers. the photo app scrollers. the calculator app-ers (which is shockingly common). the wanderers who get up to "go to the bathroom" but really just want to stretch their legs. the socializers who make friends with their neighbors. that usually happens closer to the front of the plane. there are the criers. typically children. the "readers" who sit with their book open to the first page and scroll on their phone. and of course there are the watchers who sit and judge silently.

> *(1) to be clear, this is more of a comment on the effects of constant stimulation than anything else. also unrelated but I'll just add that I think all movies should undergo the "airplane test" which tests the ability for a movie to hold your attention even when you can't hear what's going on. like on a plane. red hulk nailed it. I mean yeah it doesn't suit all movies obviously but anyways something for all the blockbuster execs reading this to consider*

some advice I've pushed for in the past which nobody seems to really like is to not be afraid of being bored. I've written about it here before. don't be that guy at the urinal that pulls out their phone and all that. I have to confess that lately I have not been upholding my own standards. at nearly 3/4 of my recent bathroom trips I have pulled out my phone. not at the urinal of course because I almost never use the urinal due to my intense parusesis (TODO: link), but same idea. this might sound like a crazy claim, but I think doing this has contributed to me feeling a bit less at peace than I usually do. a bit more bothered and unsatisfied with the state of things. maybe it's just a symptom. regardless, there's some connection there. 

a few months ago, a friend asked me whether or not I was at peace. my answer then was probably the same as it would be now: I like to think I am, but everyone now and then a day comes along and proves otherwise. I think most people probably feel that way. back then, I joked that even the Dalai Lama (TODO: check spelling) must have bad days and someone walking by laughed, probably because of how dumb it sounded. anyways, I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to maintain my peace and be the best version of myself, mainly approaching it from a positive perspective. read this (TODO: link) post I am very proud of it. but I've realized lately, as much as I hate to admit it, I might get something out of approaching it from the other side. thinking about the things that actively bring me down, rather than the preventative measures I can take. it's a bit less whimsical than before, so I hesititate to do it publicly. but I am nothing if not an oversharer. so why not.

like I mentioned earlier, I just got off a cruise. cruises are interesting because they're like a disposable, self contained, social ecosystem. a terrarium. you meet all these people and everyone is so open and willing to chat and be friendly, but nobody is under the delusion that any of these connections will last once you step off the boat. they're kinda like the first week of college in that way, but to an even greater extent. I'm not gonna pretend that I went out of my way to befriend a bunch of strangers this time around because I was in quite a bad mood for most of it for reasons I may or may not get into later, but I did witness the extroverts of my group meet some interesting people. most notably a man who claims he has been a volunteer mall Santa for over 50 years and works in the coal industry. everytime we saw him in passing he stopped us to tell an extensive, minute long joke that ended in a slightly underwhelming way. the effort was appreciated though. 

I also had an interesting conversation with a lady named Karen who was wearing a "Make America Laugh Again" hat and hates guns while I was waiting for my dad and brother-in-law to get done shooting a musket at an old military fort in Nova Scotia. she said she decided to go on a cruise because she was tired of all the bad headlines lately and wanted an escape. no internet at sea. she recounted her many travel experiences and for some reason brought up that she thinks everyone's personality is more or less fixed at birth. I pushed back on that. 

"... I used to be a preschool teacher."

"oh, wow."

"... yeah and even at like three or four all those kids have their own little personalities. they can't help it. it's just how they're born."

"oh. what do you mean?"

"it's how they're born. they can't help it if they throw a fit because they don't want to go to nap time. that's just the way they are. it's how they've been since birth and it's how they will continue to be until they get old."

"..."

"..."

"I'm not sure I agree. personality's not a monolith."

at this point, her friend walked up to her and said, "Karen, you're acting a way."

"yeah maybe, but there's nothing else to do right now." she turned back to me. 

"what do you mean by a monolith?"

"just that someone's personality can vary a lot from day to day. depending on how you're feeling, or the people you're with, or your environment. you act differently. your personality can't be fixed at birth if it isn't fixed day to day."

"no, no, you're only 35 so you don't get it..." I should mention I told her I was 35. 

"...you should've seen these kids. no matter what I did, they would throw tantrums. that's just how they are. you can't change that."

"let's not forget these are preschoolers."

she brushed that off and moved on to a different topic. I could tell there wasn't much point in trying to convince her, but I'm fairly certain she's wrong. anyways. she was cool. I didn't say goodbye as I left.

I also had a few less pleasant interactions. nothing too crazy. at a breakfast buffet one day, 


## the question


- managing people who disrupt peace
- personal relationships and beyond
- getting along with people you don't get along with
